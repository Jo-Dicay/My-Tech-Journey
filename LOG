Day 1: April 18, 2022 Monday 
Graduated 2018. Went to Europe end of 2019. Back home early 2022. Realized that I spent 3 years abroad enjoying my youth, pandemic happened, 
eventually getting depressed without learning new skills. Decided to upskill by learning new technologies to increase chances of hireability. 
Registered in freecodecamp to learn the fundamentals of programming/web development. Not yet sure if this is for me, but I will try anyway. 
Applied for coursera financial aid, Getting started with Python, Getting started with Google Workspace Specialization, and 
Microsoft 365 Fundamentals Specialization. No result yet regarding the financial aid. Applied to a call center job next city. 
Hoping to get a job nearby so I can take care of my mother.
