Day 1: April 11, 2022 Monday
Graduated BS Ecotourism 2018. Went to Europe December of 2019. Decided to come back home around March 2022. Realized that I spent 2 years abroad helping 
my host family, travelling EU, pandemic happened, eventually getting depressed, and realized after those years I didn't learn new skills to improve myself
After returning home, I decided to upskill by learning new technologies to increase chances of hireability so I could shift my career to IT. 

Registered in freecodecamp to learn the fundamentals of programming/web development. Not yet sure if this is for me, but I will try anyway. 
Applied for coursera financial aid, Getting started with Python, Getting started with Google Workspace Specialization, and 
Microsoft 365 Fundamentals Specialization. No result yet regarding the financial aid. I need to refresh my japanese language skills.
Applied to a call center job next city. Hoping to get a job nearby so I can take care of my mother.

Day 2: April 19, 2022 Tuesday
From April 11 up until now I am just reading testimonials of people who were successful tech career shifters despite not having the IT background.
I joined tech groups in different social media platforms (Facebook, Discord), continued on reading about different branches of the IT industry, just familiarizing 
myself. I took the self test from Codecademy btw. https://www.codecademy.com/explore/sorting-quiz/results?advocator=51&questioner=45&solver=32&connector=24 
I also started applying to jobs now. The first one contacted me and told me the salary was below 20k. I think I will not be able to live with that salary, given 
that I will have to start paying for electricity, water, food for two persons, including my rent and transportation next city, if I decided to proceed with 
the application. My mother will be laid off next month because of government mandate. She will stop working now as she is already a senior citizen. 
Sent more applications for remote jobs via linkedin and looked for freelance gigs online. Hope I can get a job by this month. Doesn't matter what and how much
the pay is. I just need whatever amount so I can sustain next month's bills, and hopefully I could have fiber internet installed at home as well so I can look 
for more jobs online and continue studying on free time. I am still using my phone's hotspot for internet right now while browsing resources. 

Day 3: April 20, 2022 Wednesday 
Started the first half of Basic HTML/HTML5. Got accepted as a supaagent, explored the Supahands workspace. Did the training for beginners. It gets complicated 
around Planar, Room Instance and Room Semantic Segmentation. But I will try to learn at my own pace so I can get the hang of it. Requested to join one of the projects. 

Day 4: April 23, 2022 Saturday 
Read a linkedin article about "How to TRULY be competitive for Software Jobs" 
Found out that it is very important to learn fundamentals CS knowledge. Started watching "Algorithms and Data Structures Tutorial - Full Course for Beginners"

Algorithms - a set of steps/instructions to complete a task. 

Algorithms should: 
1. clearly defined problem statement, input and output. 
2. the steps in algorithm needs to be in specific order. 
3. the steps also need to be distinct. 
4. the algorithm should produce a result. 
5. the algorithm should complete in a finite amount of time. 

Algorithm are evaluated based on: 
1. Correctness 
2. Efficiency -- time and space complexity. The shorter time you complete a task is efficient. The amount of memory taken up in the computer is also important.
