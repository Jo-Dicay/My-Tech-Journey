Day 1: April 11, 2022 Monday
Graduated BS Ecotourism 2018. Went to Europe December of 2019. Decided to come back home around March 2022. Realized that I spent 2 years abroad enjoying my youth, 
pandemic happened, eventually getting depressed without learning new skills. After returning home, I decided to upskill by learning 
new technologies to increase chances of hireability. 

Registered in freecodecamp to learn the fundamentals of programming/web development. Not yet sure if this is for me, but I will try anyway. 
Applied for coursera financial aid, Getting started with Python, Getting started with Google Workspace Specialization, and 
Microsoft 365 Fundamentals Specialization. No result yet regarding the financial aid. I need to refresh my japanese language skills.
Applied to a call center job next city. Hoping to get a job nearby so I can take care of my mother.

Day 2: April 19, 2022 Tuesday
From April 11 up until now I am just reading testimonials of people who were successful tech career shifters despite not having the IT background.
I joined tech groups in different social media platforms (Facebook, Discord), continued on reading about different branches of the IT industry, just familiarizing 
myself. I took the self test from Codecademy btw. https://www.codecademy.com/explore/sorting-quiz/results?advocator=51&questioner=45&solver=32&connector=24 
I also started applying to jobs now. The first one contacted me and told me the salary was below 20k. I think I will not be able to live with that salary, given 
that I will have to start paying for electricity, water, food for two persons, including my rent and transportation next city, if I decided to proceed with 
the application. My mother will be laid off next month because of government mandate. She will stop working now as she is already a senior citizen. 
Sent more applications for remote jobs via linkedin and looked for freelance gigs online. Hope I can get a job by this month. Doesn't matter what and how much
the pay is. I just need whatever amount so I can sustain next month's bills, and hopefully I could have fiber internet installed at home as well so I can look 
for more jobs online and continue studying on free time. I am still using my phone's hotspot for internet right now while browsing resources. 

Day 3: April 20, 2022 Wednesday 
Started the first half of Basic HTML/HTML5. Got accepted as a supaagent, explored the Supahands workspace. Did the training for beginners. It gets complicated 
around Planar, Room Instance and Room Semantic Segmentation. But I will try to learn at my own pace so I can get the hang of it. Requested to join one of the projects.
