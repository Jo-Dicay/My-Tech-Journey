Day 1: April 11, 2022 Monday 
Graduated BS Ecotourism 2018. Went to Europe December of 2019. Decided to come back home around March 2022. Realized that I spent 2 years abroad enjoying my youth, 
pandemic happened, eventually getting depressed without learning new skills. After returning home, I decided to upskill by learning 
new technologies to increase chances of hireability. 

Registered in freecodecamp to learn the fundamentals of programming/web development. Not yet sure if this is for me, but I will try anyway. 
Applied for coursera financial aid, Getting started with Python, Getting started with Google Workspace Specialization, and 
Microsoft 365 Fundamentals Specialization. No result yet regarding the financial aid. I need to refresh my japanese language skills.
Applied to a call center job next city. Hoping to get a job nearby so I can take care of my mother.
